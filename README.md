# seg3102_portfolio

This is a showcase of my Java/Angular work for SEG3102. All labs got full marks.
It is intended for employers reviewing my resum√©.
Current students cannot plagiarize because I did not use the professor's starter code template so he will know where everything came from.
The team project is not here as I did not ask for permission from my team. However, I started the team project with a copy of lab{6,7,8,9} blended together. The final version is just a more enterprise version of that on a different problem domain.
